# Palindrome-Checker
This project is a simple palindrome checker built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to Use:
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Enter a word or phrase into the input field.
Click the "Check" button to determine if the input is a palindrome.
The result will be displayed below the input field.
How It Works:
The JavaScript code takes the input, removes whitespace and converts it to lowercase.
It then reverses the string and compares it to the original.
If they match, the input is a palindrome.
Known Limitations:
Currently, only single-line inputs are supported.
The checker is case-insensitive.
Future Improvements:
Implement support for multi-line inputs.
Add options for case-sensitive checks.
Improve UI and user experience.
